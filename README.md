I am an enthusiastic Full-Stack Junior Software Developer with a career spanning four countries, working in tech for two years. Being an active, independent self-learner, Makers was the natural choice of bootcamp for me to continue my coding journey. The most exciting thing for me in this industry is how innovation, creativity and a focus on user experience are points of pride. I am looking to bring my tech and soft skills into a supportive, agile environment, where I can keep building my career on the same principles and contribute to meaningful projects.

## Skills

### Self starter



### Adaptable team player, engaging consistently with stakeholders of all levels

Working in agile, multi-disciplinary teams during my time in both HR and IT, proved invaluable during group projects at Makers, due to the diversity of backgrounds in my cohort. I also have extensive HR experience working in international teams, where I had to be inclusive in my communication in people-facing roles.  This allowed me to contribute to delivering Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) under the guidance of a simulated product owner over 2-day sprints, focusing on using agile methodologies in a team context; I was also scrum master and documented the coding journey. 

### Capacity to plan, negotiate and prioritize effectively within appropriate timeframes

Whilst pursuing the intensive course at Makers Academy, I drew heavily on my experience as a Software Development Trainee at Dogs Trust, where I delivered projects in Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Dynamics 365 on-cloud and developed solid foundations in SQL and database management; among them the integration of a third party service which replaced a paper voucher scheme for partner vet practices and migrating database functionality to the cloud, in line with GDPR practices. 

As a Recruitment Officer, I was part of a year-long working group that lead to the successful implementation of a third party bespoke recruitment system. As the most tech-savvy person in the team, I acted as liaison, translating requirements and communicating them to the tech team. The project's result was an increase response rates to candidates, it eliminated incomplete applications and led to faster selection times - crucial improvements when dealing with hundreds of applications on a weekly basis. 

### Leadership and people management

Before discovering my passion for coding, I was a Recruitment Officer for Dogs Trust, advising and supporting
managers in over 75 locations across the UK and Northern Ireland on all recruitment-related matters. During my tenure, I acted as interim team leader, managing a team of two, and led on the recruitment of approximately 300 hires per year.
