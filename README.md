I am an enthusiastic Full-Stack Junior Software Developer with a career spanning four countries, working in tech for two years. Being and active, independent self-learner, Makers was the natural choice of bootcamp for me to continue my journey. The most exciting thing for me in this industry is how innovation, creativity and a focus on user experience are points of pride. I am looking to bring my tech and soft skills into a supportive, agile environment, where I can keep building my career on the same principles and contribute to meaningful projects.
